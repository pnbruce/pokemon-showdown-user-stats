# Pokemon Showdown User Stats

The goal of this project is to track publicly available user stats on showdown. Particularly,
tracking elo over time.

## Development

The project consists of backend components written in rust. Cloud AWS infrastructure written in
CDK, and a front end which uses Vite, react, and typescript with components from shadcn.

Currently, deployment is completed by manually pulling the AWS credentials and running:

```bash
make build-and-deploy
```

However, if others want to contribute, I can set up a pipeline that automatically deploys code
committed to the repo.
